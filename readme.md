###RubrixQ
A place to compare the uncompareable

RubrixQ is a webapp designed to help people compare their favorite things across different places.

First set a category, then choose what factors matter to you. 

This builds a Rubrix, now go to different places and rate your category with the factors your chose.

Gone are the days of not being able to back up why you know a place has a better burger.
